# CustomerChurnAnalysis
The Customer Churn Analysis is the second project I worked on for my internship with PwC Switzerland on Forage Platform. This project was carried out to define Key Performance Indicators (KPI) related to customer retention.

PROBLEM STATEMENT

Janet, the Retention Manager at PhoneNow sent a mail requesting that I create a visualisation dashboard that visualises customer demographics and insights. The insights from this dashboard will be used in communicating findings and suggestions to the Engagement Partner.

PROJECT OBJECTIVES

The main objective of this project is to create a Power BI dashboard for Janet, the Retention Manager at PhoneNow, that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Customer insights in the dataset and write a concise email to the Engagement Partner explaining my findings and providing suggestions for necessary changes based on the dashboard.
